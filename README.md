# testbuilder
A small app for building tests in latex from tests in the following form 

Why did the chicken cross the street?
A) To talk to a friend
B) To get to the other side
C) The chicken did not cross the street

There should be many such questions, of course. 

The application will shuffle the order of the questions and also the order inside the answer - what was A will become e.g. C etc. 

You will get a nice looking test sheed after compiling with (pdf)LaTeX
